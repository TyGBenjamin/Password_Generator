# Password_Generator

## Description

In this Project, I created a passwrod generator that utilized prompt window to capture user input. The Generator also had to be able to toggle between, lowercase characters, uppercase characters, special and numerical Characters as well as generate random integers.This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
